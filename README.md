# Memory Game

> About a year ago, my 4 years old son asked me to play a memory game. It took me about 30 minutes looking for a memory game on Google Play that **doesn't have any jumping ads** in the middle of the game :confused:. 

`Eventually` I decided to write a new simple game without any popuping ads and release it to the store. It took me several days to design / write / test and release. Now, about a year after, I open source it.

### Features

- 2 Themes : `Animals` :cat2: & `Monsters` :octopus:
- 6 types of difficulties :star2:
- Sounds on winning :musical_note:

If you have more ideas or you want to add more options / themes / sounds or whatever, fill free to update the source for yourself or open a pull request. :sparkles:
